<p>Konnichiwa, Minnasan! My name is Atish Gupta. I'm the creator of this website you see. I created this website because.....it was my 
assignment. It was pretty fun making it because i had to make a website on basically ANYTHING. So, i chose my favourite thing, ANIME.</p> 
<p>Hunter X Hunter has been my favourite anime since i was in 9th standard so i had to make this website on it (without any doubt). 
My favourite character in it is Killua. He's cool, strong (cuz he's a trained assassin), and always there to help his BEST FRIEND (Gon).</p>
<p>Now, about my website...it's a pretty normal informative site you see. I've provided links to FAQs, Games, Characters,
<a href ="gallery.html">Gallery</a>, Anime, etc. and 
kept the site quite simple because i've lots of things to learn in case of Web Development like Bootstrap, PHP, JavaScript, etc. So, i made
it using only HTML and CSS. I wanted to make this site more interesting like animations, dropdown lists, etc. but due to lack of knowledge
could'nt. I hope in future when i learn about these languages more, i return to improve my website.</p> 
<p><span style="color:purple;">For now, MAM!! Full marks ?? :)</span></p>

<h3>Killua has been my favourite character ever since i watched him in Hunter X Hunter.</h3>
<h3>He's COOL, SMART, SKILLED, FUNNY, RELIABLE, KIND, STAYS CALM IN EVERY SITUATION and THOROUHLY EXAMINES IT FOR BEST POSSIBE OUTCOME.</h3>
<h3>I've even drew a couple of drawings of him and found his character development quite well written as how his friendship with GON 
	becomes more and more precious for him and as far as going against his own family to save his life.</h3>
<h3>That's all i've got to say :) CONGRATULATIONS!! You've found the hidden link of my favourite character. Here's the drawings i've made:</h3>
